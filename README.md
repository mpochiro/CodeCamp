This is my final project for Code Camp. In this I am using React JS as a front end frame work. Redux is also heavily involved within this project. I am using Firebase as a server and authenticating using it's processes. It's styled using SCSS and is built from the ground up, not using 'create-react-app'.

With this project I initialy learn how to MEAN stack develop however I wanted to learn React JS and during this process I was able to learn and create using React JS.
